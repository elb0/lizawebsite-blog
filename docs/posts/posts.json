It means (I hope) fewer people are waiting on you for simple answers and you have more time to address complicated or unique questions.\nHi there, \nThanks for reaching out! I get a lot of the same questions from students, so to hopefully save you and me time, I have set up this automatic reply to address several frequently asked questions. You can also read a version of this message online here. Last updated August 11.  \nIf your question isn’t related to the below, I will respond when I can.\nNote: I will be unavailable August 12–22, inclusive.\nIf your email is related to one of the topics covered below, please consider this automatic reply my response. Please note that this is especially the case for references.\nReferences: I won’t currently be saying yes to any grad school references for right now or for the next academic year, but am planning to develop more advice for students about the who/how/what of approaching me for reference letters and my policies. This won’t be till late-August/September, but below is some guidance on what to expect.\nTo be able to write a reference that would actually strengthen your application, AND to have fair criteria considering that I get easily 100—150 requests per year and can usually only write for about 20–25 students (I know that sounds small…but it still takes roughly a whole work week of time), my usual minimum criteria is at least TWO out of the following activities with me:\nactive on Piazza/office hours + good mark in a large standard class-based course (like STA303),\nstudent representative role,\nRA work,\nTA work, or \na reading course.\n\nSome examples from 2020/21 of students I said yes to: \nseveral students who had high marks in STA303 and were active and doing well in STA490 with me,\nstudents who had done STA303 and gone on to do great work as TAs or peer mentors for STA130 when I was teaching, and\na student who had done STA303 and was working on a reading course with me.\n\n\nCourse enrolment: I cannot add students to a course, waive prerequisites or move you off a waitlist. Please reach out to the UG stats team (ug.statistics@utoronto.ca) about questions of this nature.\nBook an appointment during their office hours.\nFor grad courses, please email grad.statistics@utoronto.ca.  \n\nWill [STA130/STA490/STA303] be able to be completed online-only? Yes. More information below.\nSTA130 is a completely online course (look for the ‘99’ code in the section number. More information in the Arts & Science FAQ.)  All content and assessment will be accessed/completed online.\nSTA490 lectures will be online, and you will have a choice (subject to health advice) about whether you sign up for in-person or online project meeting sections. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.\nSTA303 will be a flipped course, with content delivered online and opportunities for activities both in-person (subject to health advice) and online. All assessments will be completed and submitted online.\nSee also https://www.lizabolton.com/teaching.html. (Mostly just the same info as above).\n\nSTA490 FAQs\nWho can apply to take this course? You will be prioritized for a spot in STA490Y1 in 2021–22 if you are on track to complete the Applied Statistics Specialist or a Specialist in Statistical Science: Methods and Practice program (including a Focus) in 2021–22, and you have successfully completed STA303H1, STA304H1/STA305H1, and STA355H1. Should space in the course permit, students pursuing a Statistics Major, or another Statistics specialist program offered in the UTSG Department of Statistical Sciences (i.e., the Statistics Specialist, the Specialist in Statistical Science: Theory and Methods, or the Data Science Specialist) will be considered for enrolment in STA490Y1.  Decisions for students in these other Statistics programs of study will be made based on when the application for enrolment in STA490Y1 was received, the number of 300- and 400- level STA courses taken, and marks in these courses. Note: the application window is now closed. More information on the Department Sharepoint Special Enrolment Courses page.\nWill you be able to select which section you will be enrolled in? This will most likely be assigned based on the the range of experience and focus subjects among the selected students, as well as preferences for online or in-person meetings (selected students will be asked about this in a further survey).\n \n\nSyllabi: My 2021–22 syllabi are not yet available to students. Previous syllabi are available on the Department website (but will change year to year).  \nReading courses: STA496: Readings in Statistics must be registered for as part of special enrolment during July. I will not be taking on any further students.\nIf you’re thinking about the future, I usually consider taking on a small number of STA496 students for a half-credit, year long version.\nThere is much more information about my past students, research interests and what a course with me might be like on my website: https://www.lizabolton.com/reading_courses.html.\n\nResearch opportunities/Masters/PhDs: I do not have any research opportunities currently available. Please see the graduate section of our Department website for more information: https://www.statistics.utoronto.ca/graduate. \nTeaching assistant opportunities: See the Department website.

The idea is to chat about the original article before going to a talk called ‘Learning from Data: The Two Cultures’. (Info/registration). The speaker is Adji Bousso Dieng (Founder, The Africa I Know; Google AI; Princeton University (Incoming)) and moderator is David Blei (Columbia University; ACM Prize in Computing Recipient).\nBreiman’s article, free and in full: http://www2.math.uu.se/~thulin/mm/breiman.pdf.\nCheck list before we get started\nRegistered for the talk\nHave the paper open (even if you haven’t had a chance to read it all)  Introduce yourself: Name, year & program of study, why you were interested in this talk.\nBackground on this talk\nThis talk is part of a series of ‘TechTalks’ from the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). You can view past ACM TechTalks on their learning portal. They also have a podcast series, ByteCast.\nWhy two cultures?\nYou’ll see the idea of ‘Two Cultures’ in STEM related topics pop up now and then and (I think) they call back to a lecture given by C. P. Snow in 1959 (Wikipedia). His talk (and later book) was about how the sciences and the humanities has become two separate ‘cultures’ and that this split was a problem when it comes to trying to solve our big problems.\nDiscussion questions\nRight at the start of the introduction, Breiman says there are two goals for traditional statistical analyses: prediction and information. In your studies so far, have you done both, one more than the other, only one?\nAre you more naturally a data modelling culture member or an algorithmic modelling culture member?\nDoes Breiman’s estimate of what percentage of statisticians are in each culture seem right 20 years later? Does it surprise you?\n\nWriting: Did you find this article easy or hard to read? What did you like/helped? What was difficult?\nIn the description of the Ozone project (Section 3.1), how did the way the training and test sets were set up differ to what you might have seen usually done? Why do you think this was? Could the normal way also have worked? (Note: if you’ve never encountered training/test sets, let’s talk about that!)\nIn section 3.3, Breiman discusses his perceptions about statistical analysis after year of consulting, upon going back into academia. Did any of these surprise you? Do you disagree with any? Which of these perceptions do you already hold?\nIn section 5.2, when residual analysis is helpful/not for understanding model fit. Was there anything new you learned from this section?\nSection 5.3, discusses ‘the multiplicity of data models’. What does this mean to you? Can you connect it to the idea ‘all models are wrong, but some are useful’?\nBreiman set up the below as his goals for the paper. Do you think they were achieved?\nFocusing just on the data modelling culture has:\nLed to irrelevant theory and questionable scientific conclusions;\nKept statisticians from using more suitable algorithmic models;\nPrevented statisticians from working on exciting new problems;\n\n\nWhat is one thing in the article you’d like to learn more about and how? (Self-learning, in your courses, at future optional events?)\nIn the summary for the upcoming talk, it is stated that “there is a growing community of researchers working on methodologies embracing both cultures”, but goes on to identify two NEW cultures and how they need to work together. Any predictions about this topic? Examples from your own experience?\nQuotes I liked\n“If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools”\n“One is left with an unsettled sense about the arbitrariness of residual analysis”\n“Occam’s Razor, long admired, is usually interpreted to mean that simpler is better. Unfortunately, in prediction, accuracy and simplicity (interpretability) are in conflict”\n“the emphasis needs to be on the problem and on the data.”\nDisplay photo by freestocks on Unsplash\n\n\n\n",

They look great.)\nBenefits of live coding\nIt slows you down!\nYou actually say the name of the functions, modelling pronunciation and making it easier for students to ask questions about it!\nyou are showing process thinking as well. How do you set up your workflow?\n“Unintended knowledge transfer” how do you learn more, watching a YouTube cook-through or reading a recipe.\nTURN 👏 YOUR 👏 ERRORS 👏 INTO 👏 TEACHABLE 👏 MOMENTS\nshows you don’t have to be perfect to be able to code!\nbut this can be embarrassing or stressful…have the “something I prepared earlier” cooking show approach.\npromise the follow-up if you can’t resolve the error on the fly, have a plan B so you can be more comfortable.\nCan model things like standard practice of putting loaded packages at the beginning but SHOW that you don’t always know all the ones you want to use and so you’ll add back at the top as you go (demonstrates order)\n\nRUN RUN RUN! You’re not being charged for each run, be as lavish as you like.\nEmphasizes importance (without you having to learn to fight Xaringan…)\nThere is empirical evidence (largely from the CS literature) about this being useful for students.\nBUT! Don’t just live code\nMore formats to engage > just one\nEasy to lose/demotivate people\nCan be hard to capture (better with recording)\nSwitching between contexts (slides, live code) is a useful signal and moment to re-engage\nHow do we decide?\nLive code first if it’s how you use tools, like reprexes or using GitHub\nStatic first: new syntax and interpreting results\nLive coding considerations\nTEST, TEST, TEST, does this work on small screens? (Online)\nWhat’s the experience of the person at the back (In-person)\nMine’s students requested that she code with a dark background, because they were watching videos at night.\nYou can show how to set up the theming, too!\n\nWhen live coding in Zoom, Mine has moved the console up to the top right (on Zoom) to help it be less occluded by the Zoom bar. (Show them how to do it!)\nFor webinars and webcasts, Mine does short videos that she can narrate.\nHave a way to show the student experience of a tool (like a student account)\nChanged camera location of speaker to show different interaction styles. For the application exercises, where students are likely to code-along, the location is better for typing, vs something that is more focused on just watching the screen.\nCan use learnR modules for more ‘on rails’ live coding.\nGeneral list of things I like when Mine teaches and that I should copy:\nShares and reshares links in chat\nHas shortlink in footer of every slide\nModel running code that doesn’t run because you didn’t load the package\nDown arrow runs all code chunks above\nBrowser pop-up “You have not done anything wrong”\n“Show restraint from your usual workflow” try not to just auto-close a pop-up you know well but they’ve never seen\nGear icon (next to Knit) to stop treating like an notebook and just output to console.\n\nStart with factory settings and teach customization\nLinks\nSpeaking R from Amelia McNamara\nVideo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckW9sSdIVAc (thanks Nick Seewald)\nSlides: https://www.amelia.mn/SpeakingR/#1 (thanks Allison Theobold)\n\n📦 livecode from Mine https://github.com/rundel/livecode\nCaveat: work being done!\n\n📦 asciicast https://github.com/r-lib/asciicast\nMouseposé for showing what you’re typing!

I’m a Settler Canadian, born here, but lived half my life in Aotearoa New Zealand on Tainui and then Ngāti Whatua lands and now back on ‘Dish With One Spoon’ treaty lands.\nI’m really delighted that your group has been reading Braiding Sweetgrass, especially as June is National Indigenous History Month in Canada, so nicely done. But more importantly, you’ve been reading this as we learn more and more about the unmarked graves of Indigenous children at residential schools and perhaps grappling with what the upcoming Canada Day can or should mean to you.\nRohan invited me along to say hi because he knows I read this book because, a while back, I was up tweeting at 3:00 a.m. about how I couldn’t stop crying because of the story of the creation of Turtle Island. I certainly found the rest of the book more soothing than that.\nI wanted to highlight an early quote on sweetgrass from the book that was a perfect preface to the experience I was about to have with the book itself and that I wonder if many of you also had.\n\n“Breathe in its scent and you start to remember things you didn’t know you’d forgotten”\n\n— Robin Wall Kimmerer\n\nThis book reminded me of so many things I hadn’t realized I’d forgotten and through stories connected my heart back up and not just my head. 15 months into a pandemic, in a new city I only moved to 18 months ago, I needed to connect back to life writ larger than just human life, to cycles of reciprocity and gratitude instead of news cycles. This book helped put my feet back on a path towards a balance I’ve been dearly missing.\nIf these were some of the things you connected with to, I’d especially encourage you to learn more about the Dish With One Spoon agreement, as living here we are all invited to this treaty and in it you’ll see much of what you may have found you’d forgotten when reading this book.\n—  Liza\nResources\nU of T\nReconciliation: Walking the Path of Indigenous Allyship June 30, 1:00-2:30 p.m. ET\nThis workshop is run regularly, and is a good ‘101’ session.

In all, over 700 students in our programs signed up, and among the 164 students who responded to our end-of-summer survey, 41% were active and 48% passive participants; our data suggests that even passive participation was beneficial in making students feel more connected. As part of the ISSC, we held formal and informal data science workshops, social events, and career-building activities culminating in a DataFest COVID-19 Virtual Challenge. In all, 92 eligible teams applied to participate in DataFest, 62 were invited to compete, and 42 submitted complete submissions. In this talk, we will outline the principles guiding how the ISSC was structured including practical advice and tips for building a sustainable community, lessons learned, and plans for 2021.\nRésumé\nEn réponse aux perturbations des plans des élèves en raison de la COVID-19 et au sentiment d’isolement généralisé, nous avons créé une communauté virtuelle pour aider les étudiants à monter leur portfolio, à rencontrer leurs pairs et à découvrir des carrières. En tout, plus de 700 étudiants se sont inscrits à nos programmes et, parmi les 164 étudiants qui ont répondu à notre enquête de fin d’été, 41 % étaient des participants actifs et 48 % des participants passifs. Nos données suggèrent que même la participation passive a été bénéfique en donnant aux étudiants le sentiment d’être plus connectés. Dans le cadre de la Communauté statistique indépendante d’été, nous avons organisé des ateliers formels et informels sur les sciences des données, des événements sociaux et des activités de développement de carrière, qui ont débouché au défi virtuel des données DataFest COVID-19. Au total, 92 équipes admissibles ont posé leur candidature pour participer à ce défi, 62 ont été invitées à concourir et 42 ont soumis des dossiers complets. Dans cet exposé, nous présenterons les principes qui ont guidé la structure de la Communauté statistique indépendante d’été, les conseils pratiques et les astuces qui ont contribué à créer une communauté durable, ainsi que les leçons apprises et nos plans pour 2021.\nThe Development and Implementation of a Toolkit for Learning R at all Levels.\n 3:45 PM - 4:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, June 9\n Event link\n Samantha-Jo Caetano\nAbstract\nStatistics and data science have become ubiquitous in the hard and social sciences. When working with large data or complex methodology it is crucial that the data analysts are able to program. R is a statistical programming language that is free and popular in the statistics community. R works well for data visualizations, wrangling and employing simple to complex methodology. As educators in statistics we noticed a variation of programming backgrounds in our senior students. Our team of 7 undergraduate students, 2 graduate students, and 2 assistant professors have developed a toolkit to help students improve their programming in R. The toolkit is a set of interactive modules that students complete autonomously. The modules start from the very basics of installing R to tidyverse to employing Bayesian methods. In this talk, we will outline the development and uses of this toolkit, and highlight some next steps.\nRésumé\nLes statistiques et les sciences des données sont devenues omniprésentes dans les sciences dures et humaines. En travaillant avec des données volumineuses ou des méthodologies complexes, il est primordial que les analystes de données soient capables de programmer. R est un langage de programmation gratuit et populaire au sein de la communauté statistique. Il fonctionne à merveille pour les visualisations de données, leur préparation préalable et l’adoption de méthodologies simples ou complexes. En tant qu’éducateurs en statistique, nous avons remarqué que les formations en programmation varient parmi nos étudiants de cycle supérieur. Notre équipe de sept étudiants de premier cycle, deux étudiants de cycle supérieur et deux professeurs assistants ont conçu une boîte à outils afin d’aider les étudiants à rehausser leurs aptitudes de programmation en R. La boîte à outils est composée d’un ensemble de modules interactifs que les étudiants terminent de façon autonome. Les modules commencent par la base de l’installation de R, puis progressent vers tidyverse jusqu’à l’emploi de méthodes bayésiennes. Lors de cet exposé, nous décrirons les grandes lignes du développement et de l’utilisation de cette boîte à outils, et soulignerons les étapes à venir.\nTalk notes\nNotes and reflections of varying quality from the talks I attended + resources shared.\nNote: If I’ve written about talk and there is anything you’d like me to correct or add, please just let me know! Twitter/email links in the navigation bar.\nInvited Presidential Address: Probability, Statistics, and Murder\n Jeffrey Rosenthal,  @ProbabilityProf\nJeff took us on a journey through his experiences with media and especially as an expert witness in court cases. There are a mish-mash of links below and much more on his website: http://probability.ca.\nAn example of a case that was especially interesting/surprising was when he was an expert witness in a case about a marijuana grow-op. This story was really neat because significant jail time rests on whether or not the number of plants was more or less than 500. More than 500 leads to a mandatory three-year jail term.\nThe level of aggressive attacks you end up facing as a expert witness sounds extremely off-putting! I’m glad Jeff’s skin is think enough to go out and do this kind of work, because mine certainly is not.\nSome of Jeff’s final notes and advice:\nStatisticians are nicer, especially Canadian ones.\nBe cautious about what consulting work you agree to, especially in an adversarial context.\nYou can get paid a lot. Think about whether you want to you negotiate an hourly or fixed rate.\nThere are lots of satisfying/important aspects, but also lots of annoying/unpleasant ones, too.\n“If we statisticians don’t do it, then who will?”\nLinks\nHere are several links that were referred to during that talk or shared in chat.

BUT, what about as is scales up? What features makes these different, in context?\nWhat ‘privacy’ is interpreted as is context dependent, and expressed through jurisdictional law.\nSynthetic data generates new data by random draws from predictive models.\nDifferential privacy is a “perturbation tool”, a way to add noise/misclassify probabilistically.\nA wider ethical consider in this area is the question of which predictions are intrusions in unacceptable ways. This is more of an ethical/philosophical. When should we not make inferences?\nHow can we learn from others who have been doing risk communication (e.g., around health) to improve our own practices in official statistics\nMy background is using official statistics for social and health research in Aotearoa New Zealand, so it was excellent to dip a toe back into this world and hear about the context here.\nBig thanks to CANSSI for supporting this panel.  @CANSSIINCASS\nLinks\nDuncan, George & Keller-McNulty, Sallie & Stokes, Lynne.

Love this from the abstract: “Students often feel disengaged with data that they do not perceive as being”real\" or “authentic”, and it is important that they believe that the data they are analyzing is representative of real-world problems.\"\nLinks\nMovement breaks that can be used in experiments https://ocw.utoronto.ca/movement-breaks/\nQ&A for Statistical Education 2 session\nLot’s of support for using Slack, though size/licensing can be challenging in large courses or with institution policy. Used for the Independent Summer Statistics Community and TA management by some courses at U of T.\nCourse emails are extremely helpful! E.g., sta303@utoronto.ca. Add a communication policy to your syllabus about where to go for what. We say course email is only for personal/private matters and everything else should be done via Piazza, e.g., “How many pages should this assignment be?”, “What’s a likelihood ratio test?” etc.\nCautiously Constructing Charts\n Michael Correll, Tableau\n“We’re just making bar charts, what’s ethically laden about that!” *sarcasm intensifies*\nTypes of bad visualizations: deceptive, fragile, bullshit 1, evil\nLoved the example of the when bar charts should start at 0, but how this ‘rule’ is a major issue when you try to show line graphs of global temperature and demonstrate the serious increases.\nSo, when IS it okay to truncate the y-axis? The camps Michael identifies are: the anathemists, the line chart exceptionists, the signalers (be really explicit about truncation!). The things is, there hasn’t really be testing of effectiveness in any of this.\nFurther research suggests that rule following isn’t going to cut it! The context of the charts AND the intent are very important.\n\nThere are multiple places in the pipeline where things can go wrong, but this means there are places for us to intervene!\nThe environment is curated to data which is wrangled to prepared data which is visualized to get an image and that image is read by someone to get a message. (Michael has a nice image to go with this in his slides.)\n\nAny human-computer interaction assistance project eventually just becomes Clippy.\nLinks\nhttps://accidental-art.tumblr.com/\nFrankfurt.

Ethical Dimensions of Visualization Research. https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.07271.pdf ) if that helps.\nThe Case Against Explainable Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning\n Boris Babic, INSEAD but soon to be U of T\nWhite box (like a good ol’ GLM that is easy for a human to understand) vs a black box (e.g., deep learning models), but of course there is lots of potential for grey boxes, like how many parameters is too many? What about level of understanding of the user?\nExplainable vs interprettable\n‘Ersatz understanding’: in law/philosophy the idea of understanding is based in the ‘why’ between input and output.\nWhy isn’t this genuine understanding? Example given of post-hoc judge’s assistant noticing a pattern and saying that is why a decision was made for denying parole, when really there could be other reasons. The assistant is the white box approximation, but the judge is the black box. ‘Pseudo-understanding’.\n\nWe want explainable systems because this is tied to our ideas around accountability and trust.\nWe also want robustness (e.g., we’d expect similar advice for similar patients in a health context). White box approximations can give us a sense of ocal faithfulness but the potential to produce super different outcomes.\nIn summary, the main issues are pseudo/ersatz understanding—we have a false impression that we do understand what the black box is doing, the potential for non-stability when trying to use approximations, and the challenges due to existing issues with statistical literacy of data product users. Assumptions about causality, etc.\nLinks\nThanks to Jim Stallard for recommending Data Visualization: Charts, Maps, and Interactive Graphics by Robert Grant https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40684954-data-visualization\nBoris and collaborators have a paper coming out in this topic.

Kristian found that this was already being discussed in the risk assessment literature but in a different way. Group probabilities and uncertainty around group-wise rates.\n“People are certainly more than the weighted sum of their covariates”\nWe tend to have to make the assumption, if we’re only observing each person once, that their individual probability will be approximated by the group probability. This feels naughty.\nWhat about when you DO have multiple observations per person? Well, it allows us to “take seriously” the idea that each person should only be judged on their own actions. When using group probabilities, you are being ‘judged’ through the actions of others.\nIn this project they are looking at using Bayesian random effects distributions and testing with a large Kentucky dataset. This tends to show us that we’re in the ‘large variance’ situation where people are not closely grouped around their group mean.\nRisk assessments affect the trajectory of real people’s lives.\nLinks\nAngwin, Larson, Mattu & Lauren Kirchner.

April, July and November 2020. Interested in changes between first and second waves.\nThree main variables of interest: Cash on hand, what proportion of people are using cash, what proportion of people plan to go cashless.\nHave repeated cross-sections and longitudinal data.\nFor cross-sectional data, considering propensity score, selection into surveys. Then can condition on Y on selection in to the given survey. Compare \\(Y_1 | S_I\\) with \\(Y_2|S_2\\)\nFor longitudinal, there is another ‘propensity’, that is to stay in both surveys, as well as the selction into the two survey waves.\n“covariate balancing”, propensity scoring has two jobs: modelling the choice and balance between weighted sample and unbiased targets. The weight (with the PS) is what helps up balance the observed value to the unbiased target.\nAdvantages of covariate balancing propensity scores: calibrated weights dual problem, “robust to (parametric) misspecification”, can use GMM (stacking moments to get other parameters), flexible about the unbiased targets.\nFirst, choose the covariates for the PS - they will be your denominator for the moment calculation. Second, get functional forms for the propensity scores for the selection into each survey and attrition measure (for longitudinal).\nResults for the cash research: Some decrease in cash on hand, but increase in having used cash and\nLinks\nChen et al. (2020).

From here, students can see that as the interval width tends to 0, we get the Poisson dist.\nSpecifically, the Bernoulli procress avoids the use of \\(o(h)\\) notation and student work through the derivation, motivating the use of this notation as helpful instead of obscure.\nUse Taylor expansion\n\nLinks\nLawerence Leemis on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoXVQ0xV2VOk3XrREv5061w\nThe Development and Implementation of a Toolkit for Learning R at all Levels\n Sam Caetano (presenting), University of Toronto  @StatisticalSam\n Also check out: @RohanAlexander, @michaelycchong, @pailfodgetts\nThis was an awesome example of a large team education innovation project! 2 faculty leads, 2 graduate students and 8 undergraduate students (+support from the department)\nStudents learned a lot about GitHub and collaboration as part of their RA roles.\nThere are introductions for complete beginners and it is also very ‘jump-in-able’ for folks who are already some of the way there.\nSuggested implementation: could have quiz questions in class quizzes related to the\nLinks\nToolkit home page: https://dosstoolkit.com/\nRead the paper! https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09347\nlearnr package is great for creating interactive tutorials: https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/\nDeveloping and Revising the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes Toward Statistics: Results from a Pilot Study\n Douglas Whitaker, Mount Saint Vincent University  @DouglasWhitaker\nS-SOMAS: Student Survey of MOtivational Attitude toward Statistics\nOne of family of 6 instruments. 2 x topics (statistics, data science) across 3 x types (student, instructor and environment)\nMASDER: Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research team\n“Expectancy-Value Theory”: achievement-related choices and performance are affected by what you value and what you expect to happen.
