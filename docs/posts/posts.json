I‚Äôm a Settler Canadian, born here, but lived half my life in Aotearoa New Zealand on Tainui and then NgƒÅti Whatua lands and now back on ‚ÄòDish With One Spoon‚Äô treaty lands.\nI‚Äôm really delighted that your group has been reading Braiding Sweetgrass, especially as June is National Indigenous History Month in Canada, so nicely done.

This book helped put my feet back on a path towards a balance I‚Äôve been dearly missing.\nIf these were some of the things you connected with to, I‚Äôd especially encourage you to learn more about the Dish With One Spoon agreement, as living here we are all invited to this treaty and in it you‚Äôll see much of what you may have found you‚Äôd forgotten when reading this book.\n‚Äî  Liza\nResources\nU of T\nReconciliation: Walking the Path of Indigenous Allyship June 30, 1:00-2:30 p.m. ET\nThis workshop is run regularly, and is a good ‚Äò101‚Äô session.

In all, over 700 students in our programs signed up, and among the 164 students who responded to our end-of-summer survey, 41% were active and 48% passive participants; our data suggests that even passive participation was beneficial in making students feel more connected. As part of the ISSC, we held formal and informal data science workshops, social events, and career-building activities culminating in a DataFest COVID-19 Virtual Challenge. In all, 92 eligible teams applied to participate in DataFest, 62 were invited to compete, and 42 submitted complete submissions. In this talk, we will outline the principles guiding how the ISSC was structured including practical advice and tips for building a sustainable community, lessons learned, and plans for 2021.\nR√©sum√©\nEn r√©ponse aux perturbations des plans des √©l√®ves en raison de la COVID-19 et au sentiment d‚Äôisolement g√©n√©ralis√©, nous avons cr√©√© une communaut√© virtuelle pour aider les √©tudiants √† monter leur portfolio, √† rencontrer leurs pairs et √† d√©couvrir des carri√®res. En tout, plus de 700 √©tudiants se sont inscrits √† nos programmes et, parmi les 164 √©tudiants qui ont r√©pondu √† notre enqu√™te de fin d‚Äô√©t√©, 41 % √©taient des participants actifs et 48 % des participants passifs. Nos donn√©es sugg√®rent que m√™me la participation passive a √©t√© b√©n√©fique en donnant aux √©tudiants le sentiment d‚Äô√™tre plus connect√©s. Dans le cadre de la Communaut√© statistique ind√©pendante d‚Äô√©t√©, nous avons organis√© des ateliers formels et informels sur les sciences des donn√©es, des √©v√©nements sociaux et des activit√©s de d√©veloppement de carri√®re, qui ont d√©bouch√© au d√©fi virtuel des donn√©es DataFest COVID-19.

Dans cet expos√©, nous pr√©senterons les principes qui ont guid√© la structure de la Communaut√© statistique ind√©pendante d‚Äô√©t√©, les conseils pratiques et les astuces qui ont contribu√© √† cr√©er une communaut√© durable, ainsi que les le√ßons apprises et nos plans pour 2021.\nThe Development and Implementation of a Toolkit for Learning R at all Levels.\n 3:45 PM - 4:00 PM EDT on Wednesday, June 9\n Event link\n Samantha-Jo Caetano\nAbstract\nStatistics and data science have become ubiquitous in the hard and social sciences. When working with large data or complex methodology it is crucial that the data analysts are able to program. R is a statistical programming language that is free and popular in the statistics community. R works well for data visualizations, wrangling and employing simple to complex methodology. As educators in statistics we noticed a variation of programming backgrounds in our senior students. Our team of 7 undergraduate students, 2 graduate students, and 2 assistant professors have developed a toolkit to help students improve their programming in R. The toolkit is a set of interactive modules that students complete autonomously. The modules start from the very basics of installing R to tidyverse to employing Bayesian methods. In this talk, we will outline the development and uses of this toolkit, and highlight some next steps.\nR√©sum√©\nLes statistiques et les sciences des donn√©es sont devenues omnipr√©sentes dans les sciences dures et humaines. En travaillant avec des donn√©es volumineuses ou des m√©thodologies complexes, il est primordial que les analystes de donn√©es soient capables de programmer. R est un langage de programmation gratuit et populaire au sein de la communaut√© statistique. Il fonctionne √† merveille pour les visualisations de donn√©es, leur pr√©paration pr√©alable et l‚Äôadoption de m√©thodologies simples ou complexes. En tant qu‚Äô√©ducateurs en statistique, nous avons remarqu√© que les formations en programmation varient parmi nos √©tudiants de cycle sup√©rieur. Notre √©quipe de sept √©tudiants de premier cycle, deux √©tudiants de cycle sup√©rieur et deux professeurs assistants ont con√ßu une bo√Æte √† outils afin d‚Äôaider les √©tudiants √† rehausser leurs aptitudes de programmation en R. La bo√Æte √† outils est compos√©e d‚Äôun ensemble de modules interactifs que les √©tudiants terminent de fa√ßon autonome. Les modules commencent par la base de l‚Äôinstallation de R, puis progressent vers tidyverse jusqu‚Äô√† l‚Äôemploi de m√©thodes bay√©siennes. Lors de cet expos√©, nous d√©crirons les grandes lignes du d√©veloppement et de l‚Äôutilisation de cette bo√Æte √† outils, et soulignerons les √©tapes √† venir.\nTalk notes\nNotes and reflections of varying quality from the talks I attended + resources shared.\nNote: If I‚Äôve written about talk and there is anything you‚Äôd like me to correct or add, please just let me know! Twitter/email links in the navigation bar.\nInvited Presidential Address: Probability, Statistics, and Murder\n Jeffrey Rosenthal,  @ProbabilityProf\nJeff took us on a journey through his experiences with media and especially as an expert witness in court cases. There are a mish-mash of links below and much more on his website: http://probability.ca.\nAn example of a case that was especially interesting/surprising was when he was an expert witness in a case about a marijuana grow-op. This story was really neat because significant jail time rests on whether or not the number of plants was more or less than 500. More than 500 leads to a mandatory three-year jail term.\nThe level of aggressive attacks you end up facing as a expert witness sounds extremely off-putting! I‚Äôm glad Jeff‚Äôs skin is think enough to go out and do this kind of work, because mine certainly is not.\nSome of Jeff‚Äôs final notes and advice:\nStatisticians are nicer, especially Canadian ones.\nBe cautious about what consulting work you agree to, especially in an adversarial context.\nYou can get paid a lot. Think about whether you want to you negotiate an hourly or fixed rate.\nThere are lots of satisfying/important aspects, but also lots of annoying/unpleasant ones, too.\n‚ÄúIf we statisticians don‚Äôt do it, then who will?‚Äù\nLinks\nHere are several links that were referred to during that talk or shared in chat. (Not exhaustive.)\nLottery link: http://probability.ca/lotteryscandal/\nAnnals Quadfecta: https://imstat.org/2021/05/14/the-annals-quadfecta-23/\nJeff‚Äôs Canadian Supreme Court opinion writing article: http://probability.ca/jeff/ftpdir/SCC_UTLJ.pdf\nDiscussion of SIDS/SUDI case history: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sally_Clark\n‚ÄúThe Clark case has its Aussie version that continues as Jeff speaks.‚Äù - Grace Chiu https://www.seattletimes.com/seattle-news/health/australian-mom-convicted-of-killing-4-children-seeks-pardon/\n\nwww.probability.ca/justice\nData privacy in official statistics (Panel Session)\n Donald Estep, Canadian Statistical Sciences Institute and Simon Fraser University,  @donestep1\n Natalie Shlomo, University of Manchester\n John Eltinge, US Census Bureau\n Anne-Sophie Charest, Universit√© Laval\n Pierre Desrochers, Statistics Canada\nPeople don necessarily understand what their own views on disclosure/privacy look like mathematically.\nWhat is inference vs what is disclosure.\nUniqueness: if you publish something that is unique to one person, that is disclosure and that is fairly well agreed upon. BUT, what about as is scales up? What features makes these different, in context?\nWhat ‚Äòprivacy‚Äô is interpreted as is context dependent, and expressed through jurisdictional law.\nSynthetic data generates new data by random draws from predictive models.\nDifferential privacy is a ‚Äúperturbation tool‚Äù, a way to add noise/misclassify probabilistically.\nA wider ethical consider in this area is the question of which predictions are intrusions in unacceptable ways. This is more of an ethical/philosophical. When should we not make inferences?\nHow can we learn from others who have been doing risk communication (e.g., around health) to improve our own practices in official statistics\nMy background is using official statistics for social and health research in Aotearoa New Zealand, so it was excellent to dip a toe back into this world and hear about the context here.\nBig thanks to CANSSI for supporting this panel.  @CANSSIINCASS\nLinks\nDuncan, George & Keller-McNulty, Sallie & Stokes, Lynne.

Used for the Independent Summer Statistics Community and TA management by some courses at U of T.\nCourse emails are extremely helpful! E.g., sta303@utoronto.ca. Add a communication policy to your syllabus about where to go for what. We say course email is only for personal/private matters and everything else should be done via Piazza, e.g., ‚ÄúHow many pages should this assignment be?‚Äù, ‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs a likelihood ratio test?‚Äù etc.\nCautiously Constructing Charts\n Michael Correll, Tableau\n‚ÄúWe‚Äôre just making bar charts, what‚Äôs ethically laden about that!‚Äù *sarcasm intensifies*\nTypes of bad visualizations: deceptive, fragile, bullshit 1, evil\nLoved the example of the when bar charts should start at 0, but how this ‚Äòrule‚Äô is a major issue when you try to show line graphs of global temperature and demonstrate the serious increases.\nSo, when IS it okay to truncate the y-axis? The camps Michael identifies are: the anathemists, the line chart exceptionists, the signalers (be really explicit about truncation!). The things is, there hasn‚Äôt really be testing of effectiveness in any of this.\nFurther research suggests that rule following isn‚Äôt going to cut it! The context of the charts AND the intent are very important.\n\nThere are multiple places in the pipeline where things can go wrong, but this means there are places for us to intervene!\nThe environment is curated to data which is wrangled to prepared data which is visualized to get an image and that image is read by someone to get a message. (Michael has a nice image to go with this in his slides.)\n\nAny human-computer interaction assistance project eventually just becomes Clippy.\nLinks\nhttps://accidental-art.tumblr.com/\nFrankfurt.

What about level of understanding of the user?\nExplainable vs interprettable\n‚ÄòErsatz understanding‚Äô: in law/philosophy the idea of understanding is based in the ‚Äòwhy‚Äô between input and output.\nWhy isn‚Äôt this genuine understanding? Example given of post-hoc judge‚Äôs assistant noticing a pattern and saying that is why a decision was made for denying parole, when really there could be other reasons. The assistant is the white box approximation, but the judge is the black box. ‚ÄòPseudo-understanding‚Äô.\n\nWe want explainable systems because this is tied to our ideas around accountability and trust.\nWe also want robustness (e.g., we‚Äôd expect similar advice for similar patients in a health context). White box approximations can give us a sense of ocal faithfulness but the potential to produce super different outcomes.\nIn summary, the main issues are pseudo/ersatz understanding‚Äîwe have a false impression that we do understand what the black box is doing, the potential for non-stability when trying to use approximations, and the challenges due to existing issues with statistical literacy of data product users. Assumptions about causality, etc.\nLinks\nThanks to Jim Stallard for recommending Data Visualization: Charts, Maps, and Interactive Graphics by Robert Grant https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/40684954-data-visualization\nBoris and collaborators have a paper coming out in this topic.

Kristian found that this was already being discussed in the risk assessment literature but in a different way. Group probabilities and uncertainty around group-wise rates.\n‚ÄúPeople are certainly more than the weighted sum of their covariates‚Äù\nWe tend to have to make the assumption, if we‚Äôre only observing each person once, that their individual probability will be approximated by the group probability. This feels naughty.\nWhat about when you DO have multiple observations per person? Well, it allows us to ‚Äútake seriously‚Äù the idea that each person should only be judged on their own actions. When using group probabilities, you are being ‚Äòjudged‚Äô through the actions of others.\nIn this project they are looking at using Bayesian random effects distributions and testing with a large Kentucky dataset. This tends to show us that we‚Äôre in the ‚Äòlarge variance‚Äô situation where people are not closely grouped around their group mean.\nRisk assessments affect the trajectory of real people‚Äôs lives.\nLinks\nAngwin, Larson, Mattu & Lauren Kirchner.

When constructing cells should use variables highly correlated with the outcome.\n‚ÄúShrinking from both sides‚Äù.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: List of papers about MRP authored by Si and colleagues\n\n\n\nLinks\nLittle.

April, July and November 2020. Interested in changes between first and second waves.\nThree main variables of interest: Cash on hand, what proportion of people are using cash, what proportion of people plan to go cashless.\nHave repeated cross-sections and longitudinal data.\nFor cross-sectional data, considering propensity score, selection into surveys. Then can condition on Y on selection in to the given survey. Compare \\(Y_1 | S_I\\) with \\(Y_2|S_2\\)\nFor longitudinal, there is another ‚Äòpropensity‚Äô, that is to stay in both surveys, as well as the selction into the two survey waves.\n‚Äúcovariate balancing‚Äù, propensity scoring has two jobs: modelling the choice and balance between weighted sample and unbiased targets. The weight (with the PS) is what helps up balance the observed value to the unbiased target.\nAdvantages of covariate balancing propensity scores: calibrated weights dual problem, ‚Äúrobust to (parametric) misspecification‚Äù, can use GMM (stacking moments to get other parameters), flexible about the unbiased targets.\nFirst, choose the covariates for the PS - they will be your denominator for the moment calculation. Second, get functional forms for the propensity scores for the selection into each survey and attrition measure (for longitudinal).\nResults for the cash research: Some decrease in cash on hand, but increase in having used cash and\nLinks\nChen et al.¬†(2020).

From here, students can see that as the interval width tends to 0, we get the Poisson dist.\nSpecifically, the Bernoulli procress avoids the use of \\(o(h)\\) notation and student work through the derivation, motivating the use of this notation as helpful instead of obscure.\nUse Taylor expansion\n\nLinks\nLawerence Leemis on YouTube https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoXVQ0xV2VOk3XrREv5061w\nThe Development and Implementation of a Toolkit for Learning R at all Levels\n Sam Caetano (presenting), University of Toronto  @StatisticalSam\n Also check out: @RohanAlexander, @michaelycchong, @pailfodgetts\nThis was an awesome example of a large team education innovation project! 2 faculty leads, 2 graduate students and 8 undergraduate students (+support from the department)\nStudents learned a lot about GitHub and collaboration as part of their RA roles.\nThere are introductions for complete beginners and it is also very ‚Äòjump-in-able‚Äô for folks who are already some of the way there.\nSuggested implementation: could have quiz questions in class quizzes related to the\nLinks\nToolkit home page: https://dosstoolkit.com/\nRead the paper! https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.09347\nlearnr package is great for creating interactive tutorials: https://rstudio.github.io/learnr/\nDeveloping and Revising the Student Survey of Motivational Attitudes Toward Statistics: Results from a Pilot Study\n Douglas Whitaker, Mount Saint Vincent University  @DouglasWhitaker\nS-SOMAS: Student Survey of MOtivational Attitude toward Statistics\nOne of family of 6 instruments. 2 x topics (statistics, data science) across 3 x types (student, instructor and environment)\nMASDER: Motivational Attitudes in Statistics and Data Science Education Research team\n‚ÄúExpectancy-Value Theory‚Äù: achievement-related choices and performance are affected by what you value and what you expect to happen.
