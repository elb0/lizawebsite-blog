Notes and links to support the Data Democratisation panel, [2023 Science Communicators Association of New Zealand Conference: *Techtopia: Navigating the power, potential and perils of technology in science communication*](https://www.scanz.co.nz/2023-conference).

This conference took place November 16 & 17, 2023 in Te Whanganui-a-Tara Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand.

## Speakers

-   Dr Karaitiana Taiuru

-   Keith Ng, Ministry of Housing and Urban Development

-   Mike Taitoko, TakiwƒÅ, Tohu & Calm the Farm

-   Liza Bolton, University of Auckland

## Event description

A panel discussion following Karaitiana Taiuru's keynote.

The panel will be driven by facilitator and attendee questions, with the main thrust being about helping science communicators to understand the important considerations that go into building, publicising and making available scientific data. We hope that the audience will go away with two or three practical things they can use in thinking about data - in gathering, in distribution, and in promotion.

Their construction boots have a snazzy little heal and there is a reflection on the ground. The text: "This post is a work in progress" has been added in the top right corner. This image was created using DALLE-2 with the prompt: "a construction worker working on a 3d bar chart that looks like a building"](images/workinprogress_text.png)

> -   **"It is the mark of a truly intelligent person to be moved by statistics"**<s>George Bernard Shaw</s>, Bertrand Russell (kinda)

Oft mis-attributed to George Bernard Shaw (an excellent quipper to be in company with!), this quote has been versioned and recycled across time. It was really about education and developing people's sympathies to the point that abstract information about the world could be as moving, and so motivating, as a really personal story from a specific person.

Intelligence is notoriously problematic to measure (probably because it is notoriously poorly defined...), so I'd propose a variation..."*good science communication can help all people be moved by statistics, or at least with the help of them*".

## Three archetypes of data stories

I think you could claim that there are three data story archetypes. Most situations include parts of all three of these, but I think it can help to consider their interplay in the data you're collecting, using or disseminating.

1.  Means to an [***end***]{.underline}
2.  [**Means**]{.underline} (to an end?)
3.  <s>Means to an end</s>

## Means to an [***end***]{.underline}

Data was needed and used to tell a story, but the data itself isn't a big part of the story, just enabling answering the research question. If you could wave a magic wand that guaranteed the data was appropriately collected and measured for your research question, you'd not need to talk about it all. ü™Ñ But of course, the worthiness of the research question itself is important, too! And I'm honestly not sure this truly exists in the real world, I suppose neither of the first two archetypes really exist in full purity...but folks certainly might present things like this.

### üëé 5D approaches to indigenous data 

> Statistics have long been used as a tool for shaping the narrative about Indigenous People, communities, and nations through the use of 5 D data---\"a set of items related almost exclusively to measure Indigenous difference, disparity, disadvantage, dysfunction and deprivation\". This pathologizing approach to data creation and analysis has led to dysfunctional policies that are then used to justify the need for more data focused on the 5 Ds and that shape dominant society\'s understanding of Indigenous People.

### üëç Journos adding data notes

I'm seeing more an more a little (or not so little) data notes portion at the end of articles. This is a great way to balance what flows in an article and isn't the core story, with allowing folks who want to sink their teeth in further. To be fair these examples are very much data journalism, so these are the folks rocking it!

-   Kate Newton for the ABC, [*The Big Swing: El Ni√±o in a changing climate*](https://www.abc.net.au/news/2023-09-07/el-nino-southern-oscillation-climate-change-effects-on-australia/102788002)

-   The Pudding are leaders in this space: [*What does a happily ever after look like?*](https://pudding.cool/2023/10/romance-covers/)by Alice Liang (with Jan Diehm). Lovely, succinct Methods & Notes section at the end.

### Measurement is hard

-   There is an incredible anecdote in the book *The Victory Lab: The Secret Science of Winning Campaigns* by Sasha Issenberg that also highlights why our STEM folks need exposure to ethics and humanities. It goes something like so: In a meeting on collecting data to try to assess the possible impacts of racist sentiments among voters on Obama's campaign, one of the suggestions from a hot shot data wonk from MIT (or something like that) suggested they just ask people in surveys if they were racist...then you'd know if they were racist. Yep, that is definitely a suggestion.

## [**Means**]{.underline} (to an **end?)**

This is when the data is the story itself. Whether related to privacy, consent, data sovereignty, etc., even without any particular 'finding', there are concerns/conversations about the data. Often this is because of the risks of misusing the data, but these don't have to have eventuated.

### Open data

-   üì£ Panellist Keith Ng's 2017 article on open data: [*I\'m a data nerd and a data cheerleader, but still I fear Bill English\'s datatopia*](https://thespinoff.co.nz/society/13-01-2017/im-a-data-nerd-and-a-data-cheerleader-but-still-i-fear-bill-englishs-datatopia)*,* on the Spinoff

### üëç *Datasheets* for explaining data 

While the article is specifically about machine learning, the questions worked through when creating a datasheet are valuable for sharing any kind of dataset in an accessible and consistent way.

> Gebru, Timnit, Jamie Morgenstern, Briana Vecchione, Jennifer Wortman Vaughan, Hanna Wallach, Hal Daum√© III, and Kate Crawford. 2021. "Datasheets for Datasets." *Communications of the ACM* 64 (12): 86--92. <https://doi.org/10.1145/3458723>.
>
> *Datasheets for datasets are intended to address the needs of two key stakeholder groups: dataset creators and dataset consumers. For dataset creators, the primary objective is to encourage careful reflection on the process of creating, distributing, and maintaining a dataset, including any underlying assumptions, potential risks or harms, and implications of use. For dataset consumers, the primary objective is to ensure they have the information they need to make informed decisions about using a dataset. Transparency on the part of dataset creators is necessary for dataset consumers to be sufficiently well informed that they can select appropriate datasets for their chosen tasks and avoid unintentional misuse.*

## <s>Means to an end</s>

Uh oh, missing, 404, data not found.

This might sounds strange coming from a statistician, but sometimes the most important data story is the story about where the data *isn't.*What's MISSING?

> üñºÔ∏è Check out the incredible mixed-media installation *The Library of Missing Datasets* (2016) by [MIMI ·ªåN·ª§·ªåHA](https://mimionuoha.com/). It is "a physical repository of those things that have been excluded in a society where so much is collected.
>
> "Missing data sets" are the blank spots that exist in spaces that are otherwise data-saturated."

üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [This recent article by the marvellous Sapeer Mayron](https://www.stuff.co.nz/pou-tiaki/300938784/data-shows-ongoing-racial-bias-in-police-warrantless-searches) draws attention to a pattern of increasingly missing ethnicity data in police warrants. There are a lot of possible reasons we might see this from the plausibly positive (officers not assuming ethnicity where they might once have?), to the clerical (overly burdensome reporting mechanisms? quality data entry not rewarded/taught/checked?), to the problematic (pressure to minimise known disparities in warrants by ethnicity). In the end, we don't know why the missing have increased, but I'm glad to see this question being posed.

## We like patterns and certainty, and that can be a problem

We're either really good at seeing patterns where they may or may not exist, or at ignoring a more complex picture in favour of the false solidity of a single number.

-   Sometimes we get fixated on a number without putting it in context of its distribution. The shown summary statistics for all the following charts are the same to two decimal places. I don't know about you, but I'd want to know if there was a T-Rex in *my* data*.*

The plot on the left alternates between a range of shapes, including a star, 9 dot clusters, parallel lines (vertical, horizontal, diagonals), and most importantly, a T-Rex.
