## Event description

A panel discussion following Karaitiana Taiuru's keynote.

The panel will be driven by facilitator and attendee questions, with the main thrust being about helping science communicators to understand the important considerations that go into building, publicising and making available scientific data. We hope that the audience will go away with two or three practical things they can use in thinking about data - in gathering, in distribution, and in promotion.
