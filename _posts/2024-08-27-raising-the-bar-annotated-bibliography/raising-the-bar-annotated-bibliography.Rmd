Kia ora! If you found your way here through my talk, thank you so much for coming. Skip down to the [annotated bibliography](https://blog.lizabolton.com/posts/2024-08-27-raising-the-bar-annotated-bibliography/#annotated-bibliography). If you found this some other way...welcome! There is some information on the event below.

## Event information
### Abstract
What do motivational posts on LinkedIn have in common with the supposedly small feet of Victorians? Join Dr Liza Bolton as she explores the habits of statistical thinking that can make our day-to-day lives better – from picking a restaurant like a statistician, to why you shouldn’t necessarily believe a bus stop advertisement when it tells you your hometown is one of New Zealand’s most monogamous. There are no mathematics prerequisites here – number lovers and loathers alike are invited on a romp through the good, the bad and the ugly from a world full of data and decisions.

### Bio
Dr Liza Bolton teaches statistics and data science at the University of Auckland, having recently returned from three years at the University of Toronto in Canada. She is also a statistical consultant, though tends to prefer the term “data ambassador” to describe her work representing people's data back to them in meaningful ways. Her interests lie in the realms of health, equity and education, with her research focusing on statistics education and applied statistics, specifically exploring social anVd economic predictors of mortality in Aotearoa.

### Event
6:30pm @[Norma Taps](https://normataps.co.nz/), 90 Wellesley Street West, Auckland CBD, Auckland 1010

Also speaking at this location at 8:00pm is [Rebecca Sharp](https://www.rtbevent.com/rebecca-sharp)

### Turns our you can trust 'big garlic' 🧄...or 'big ergonomic chair'

I am a big fan of Hayden Donnell's work and the below Mediawatch episode from a year ago is no exception! It is a 9'31" listen and looks at the rise of coverage of 'research' provided by organisations that is intended as advertising much more than

Importantly, the above story notes: "journalists who might have questions about a study's credibility [should] contact the publicly-funded [Science Media Centre](https://www.sciencemediacentre.co.nz/) for advice." For transperancy, I should note that I am listed on the [SciMex](https://www.scimex.org/about/scimex) directory and have been paid for a workshop for a Data Journalism program they were running.

## Don't tell me what the data says, the data says shit

The [We All Count](https://weallcount.com/) project for equity in data science has some incredible 'merch' to share some key ideas about their mission, to "work towards a world where data science is good, and good for everyone".

This is one of my favourites:

## The statistical-thinking bogs

The following is about students in intro stats classes, but I think it is also really helpful for checking in on your own thinking and anticipating how others may engage with your communication about data and models.

> ...students tend to enter and leave most introductory statistics courses thinking of statistics in one of at least two incorrect ways:
>
> 1\. Students believe that statistics and mathematics are similar in that statistical problems have a single correct answer; an answer that tells us indisputable facts about the world we live in (Bog #1: overconfidence) (Nicholson & Darnton, 2003; Pfannkuch & Brown, 1996),
>
> or,
>
> 2\. Students believe that statistics can be 'made to say anything,' like 'magic,' and so cannot be trusted. Thus, statistics is viewed as disconnected and useless for scientific research and society (Bog #2: disbelief) (Martin, 2003; Pfannkuch & Brown, 1996).

## Motivational memes, the small feet of Victorians and armouring planes
